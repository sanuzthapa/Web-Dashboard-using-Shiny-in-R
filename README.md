## üîç Project Overview  

This project focuses on analyzing wages in various categories through a **web-based dashboard** built with **Shiny** and **R**. The application provides an interactive interface for data analysis, eliminating the need for programming expertise to perform complex statistical tasks.

---

## üöÄ Features  

- **Upload Section**: Allows users to upload `.csv` files for analysis.  
- **Data Filtering**: Dynamically filter wages using sliders.  
- **Dynamic Variable Selection**: Include or exclude variables from models by ticking checkboxes, with results updating in real-time.  
- **Regression Analysis**: Build and compare multiple regression models directly on the web.  
- **Residuals Histogram**: Visualize model residuals for diagnostic checks.  
- **Correlation Plot**: Interactive visualization of variable correlations.  
- **Download Processed Data**: Export cleaned and processed data as a `.csv` file.

## Dynamic Boxplot  

Boxplots are dynamically updated when the wage filter slider is adjusted, offering instant insights into data distributions.

## Dynamic Regression Model  

Add or remove variables for regression analysis dynamically. The results update in real-time, making it easier to experiment with different models.

## Model Comparison  

Two models are built and compared dynamically:  

1. **Model 1**: `lm(Wage ~ Female + Age, data = eec)`  
2. **Model 2**: `lm(Wage ~ Female + Age + Study_nodiploma + Study_brevet + Study_capbep + Study_bac + Study_superieur, data = eec)`

## Residuals Histogram  

Histogram of residuals helps identify whether they follow a normal distribution.
